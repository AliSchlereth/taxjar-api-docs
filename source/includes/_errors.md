## 400 Bad Request

If you receive the message "No from address, no nexus address, and no address on file", we recommend providing `from_` or `nexus_addresses[]` depending on the endpoint's accepted parameters. Otherwise [sign in](https://app.taxjar.com/sign_in) and provide your [business address and locations](https://app.taxjar.com/account) in TaxJar.

Additionally, we provide specific 400 error messages for invalid data:

- Invalid ZIP and state combinations for `to_zip`, `to_state` and `from_zip`, `from_state`

### Taxes

- `amount` param does not equal sum of `line_items`

### Transactions

- `amount` param does not equal sum of `line_items` + `shipping`
- `line_items[][description]` param exceeds limit of 255 characters

## 401 Unauthorized

Verify your API token is correct and make sure you're correctly setting the [Authorization header](#authentication).

## 403 Forbidden

Make sure you have an active API token with TaxJar by [reviewing your account](https://app.taxjar.com/account). Your trial or subscription may have expired. If you're still not sure what's wrong, [contact us](http://www.taxjar.com/contact) and we'll investigate.

## 406 Not Acceptable

This error occurs most often when posting form-encoded data with parameters such as `nexus_addresses[]` or `line_items[]`. If your code looks correct, try submitting the request with a `Content-Type: application/json` header. **Data should always be JSON-encoded.**
